# WeatherDashboard

This application uses a third party API from a weather server to determine the current weather and the forecast for the next 5 days. 
The user is able to input any city name and the program will return the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, date and uv index. 
It also shows an icon depending on current forecast. I then used this api to display at the bottom the forecast for the next 5 days with the 
temperature, date, and humidity. Whenever the user searches a city, it will save it onto local storage and will show them to the user, and if the
user selects the city, it will reopen the forecast for that city. There is also a clear button to remove all cities on that list and clear local storage. I then used bootstrap for page styling, ui improvements, and page responsiveness.
